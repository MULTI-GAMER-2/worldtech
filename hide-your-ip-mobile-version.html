    <p>An IP address is a numerical representation of where a device is connected to the internet. It serves to identify where a device is and, to some degree, the nature of that device. Understanding the fundamentals of IP addresses is essential to being able to use the internet. Read on and learn how IP addresses work and why protecting yours is so important.</p>

    <h2>How do IP addresses work?</h2>
<p>Post offices use the physical address as a marker for the actual location of a person, home or business. It's how your letters get to you. It's your address. It's how people know where you are.</p>
<p>All of these descriptions apply to an IP address, digitally. An IP address is where a computer resides, in the virtual sense, not in terms of GPS coordinates. The IP address can identify your own computer, a favorite website, a network server and even a device (such as a webcam).</p>
<p>IP addresses are especially important for sending and receiving information. They direct internet traffic where it's needed and direct emails to your inbox.</p>
<p>The important thing to remember is that: Every device active on the internet has an IP address.</p>
 <p>IP addresses identify "where something is" in the same way that postal addresses provide your home's location.</p><br><br><br>

<p>First, TCP/IP...
IP addresses are at least a part of the internet's architecture. After all, having a postal address for your home is useless unless there is a responsible post office to deliver the mail. In terms of the internet, IP is a part of TCP/IP.</p>
<p><b>Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol</b> (TCP/IP) is a set of rules and procedures for connecting devices over the internet. TCP/IP specifies how data is exchanged: Data is divided into packets and passed through a chain of routers from source to destination. This is the fundamental foundation of internet connectivity.</p>

<p>TCP defines how applications communicate over the network. It manages how a message is divided into a series of <b>smaller packets</b>, which are transmitted over the internet and reassembled in the right order at the source address.</p>

<p>The IP part of the protocol defines how to address and direct each packet to ensure it reaches the correct destination. Each gateway computer on the network checks this IP address to determine where to forward the message.</p>

    <h2>What is the purpose of the IP address?</h2>
    <p>The purpose of the IP address is to handle the connection between the device and the destination website. The IP address uniquely identifies each device on the internet. Without that, there would be no way to get in touch with him. IP addresses allow computing devices (such as PCs and tablets) to communicate with destinations such as websites and streaming services, and let websites know who is connecting.</p>

    <p>An IP address also serves as a return address, just as with a postal address. If a sent letter is delivered to the wrong address, it goes back to the sender if he has written his address on the envelope. The same goes for an email. When writing an invalid recipient (such as a correspondent who has left the company), the IP address will allow the company's email server to send an email back saying the recipient was not found.</p>

    <h2>IP address security</h2>
    
    
    <p>You must protect your IP address in the same way as your home address. Criminals can try to take advantage of you in a number of ways. They can:</p>
    
    <li><a>Use your IP address identity to <b>download illegal content:</b></a> Pirates can download movies, music and other content and look like you did it. So, you could get in trouble with your internet provider for something you didn't do.</p>
    </li>
    <li><a>Track your <b>home address:</b></a> You can track an IP address to a physical address. This could expose you to physical danger or theft if you are not at home. Security experts have long advised people to never tell social media that they're on vacation, as it lets criminals know when you're not home. It's good to follow this advice for privacy reasons.</p>
    </li>
    <li><a>Spying on your <b>private internet traffic:</b></a> Your sensitive data, including financial information, can be at risk when cybercriminals gain access to your IP traffic.</p>
    </li>
    <li><a><b>Attack it directly:</b></a> There are many tools circulating among cybercriminals to initiate various types of attacks, especially one of DDoS (distributed denial of service), where a website is flooded with so much traffic that it becomes so congested that it shuts down. Consider adding privacy tools to your suite of online tools, including one that hides your IP address.</p>
